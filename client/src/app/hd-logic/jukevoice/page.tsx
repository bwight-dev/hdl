              <strong>Jukevoice</strong> is Juke, of course. He has been the voice of our book all along. While he is 
              limited to about thirty spoken words and knows around a dozen signs, his vocalizations, such as clicks 
              and other sounds, number in the dozens. His thoughts must be more complex than mine!

              <strong>Why have a separate voice?</strong> My thoughts are chemical, boosted and formed by the pharmaceutical 
              medication I take. Time is a major constraint for me. I&apos;m often thinking of the timeâ€”what minute? What hour? 
              What year? How long is this taking? When do I eat next? Are we there yet?

              <strong>Time is nearly irrelevant to Juke.</strong> Heavenly Dream Logic has no time or linguistic or mathematical constraint.

              <strong>Jukevoice</strong> is me trying to sensate Juke&apos;s sensational thoughts into words. I would describe 
              this book as having been written by Juke, like someone who only thinks in pictures and physical feelings 
              using language software for the first time.
