              Juke is a teenager with autism and intellectual disability. He attacks his caregivers and is sent to live in a group home for dangerous youth.

              At the institution, he must suffer the workers&apos; abuse and the other boys&apos; contempt. During a few special moments, he is blessed with kindness and friendship.

              Juke&apos;s parents, Dad and Mom, visit every week and do their best to cherish him. They recall their experiences from when Juke was young to his eventual institutionalization twenty years later.

              Juke cannot speak, but at bedtime he dreams of a spiritual world before any of us were born. The dream protagonists—Emily and Julian—explore the consequences of their pending mortality.

              Julian is weak and beset by Angels, those spirits who do not follow Righteousness. Angels are ruled by Dragons, who hate Righteousness and seek to destroy its eternal spirits.
            </p>

              Emily tells Julian that she has been chosen to care for a great one born with exceptional mental challenges. She prays to Eternal God for a husband to accompany her, and He has recommended Julian.

              Emily and Julian are captured by the Dragons and sentenced to be induced (slang for Wickedly executed).
