                Emily and Julian sleep well and arise in good spirits even though they are to be induced. They dress up in the 
                best armor reserved for Of the Noble and Great Ones, Emily wearing her medallion and Julian his medal.

                The Disinspirited guide Emily and Julian to the Righteous place set aside for the celebration and inducement. 
                They enter a large assembly hall with a vast congregation of spirits, but they do not recognize anyone except 
                Robert and Richard. Everyone ignores them except one gossipy spirit.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-300 mb-4">
                The celebration begins but it turns out to be a regular church service. Robert announces the failure of Emily 
                and Julian&apos;s &ldquo;mission&rdquo; and their impending inducement. Robert recognizes the Johnson Brothers, four spirit 
                brothers recently named Of the Noble and Great Ones after fighting the Dragons and surviving. The Johnson Brothers 
                will soon be leaving to train for their &ldquo;missions,&rdquo; and the members of the congregation swoon over them.

              <p className="text-gray-300 mb-4">
                After the celebration, Emily and Julian are sent to change into drab Righteous clothes for their inducement, but 
                they agree not to change. Julian waits for Emily and grows concerned about the delay. Julian listens to the orchestra 
                practice a &ldquo;eulogy in song.&rdquo; Emily arrives dressed in a beautiful white gown and she and Julian formally renew 
                their vowsâ€”united as family. Outside, in the shadow of the mountains, they discuss what it means to be &ldquo;special.&rdquo;

              <p className="text-gray-300 mb-4">
                Emily and Julian hear a fanfare and walk to the temple. A servant leads them to a single horse and they ride 
                together up to the inducement arena. Music continues to play as they enter the arena. A servant asks if Emily 
                is ready. Emily and Julian share a final embrace. She walks into the arena and briefly enters a side room. She 
                reemerges and climbs up the platform. Emily is induced with her eyes fixed on Julian. Julian watches as the 
                servants recover her remains. They bring the remains and Emily&apos;s medallion to Julian and inquire what to do 
                with them, but Julian cannot decide.

                It is Julian&apos;s turn in the arena. He enters the side room set apart for final reflection before birth. Sister 
                spirits Bene and Lu greet him. Bene takes care of Lu, who has disabilities, and they work together. Julian 
                ponders this arrangement.

              <p className="text-gray-300">
                Julian declares Bene Of the Noble and Great Ones and prepares for his own inducement, accepting his fate and 
                the transition from the pre-mortal world to birth on Earth.
