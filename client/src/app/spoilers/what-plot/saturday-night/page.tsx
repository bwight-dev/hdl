                Julian is greeted in prison by a friendly Guardian Angel who informs him that Emily is still alive but also a 
                prisoner and will be joining Julian at Satan&apos;s Court and to be induced. Julian is anxious to leave the prison 
                and reunite with Emily.

                Courteous Guardian Angels escort Julian by horseback to Satan&apos;s Court. Emily and Julian are reunited and exchange 
                the details of their respective &ldquo;missions.&rdquo; They are escorted to a mountainside cliff estate overlooking the beach 
                and the ocean, which is Satan&apos;s Court.

              <p className="text-gray-300 mb-4">
                Emily and Julian are greeted by Lilith. The Scriptures begin with impromptu introductory psalms by Julian, Lilith, 
                and Satan. Lilith and Satan introduce Emily and Julian into their home and show them the world. They introduce 
                Natalie, their adopted daughter with disabilities. They all hike to the pinnacle for a picnic and to meet the Dragons. 
                Lilith teaches &ldquo;we each must fill our measure of creation.&rdquo;

              <p className="text-gray-300 mb-4">
                The group goes to the beach to swim. Natalie wears swim aids that Satan made for her. Lilith holds court on the 
                beach, teaching that spirits live in fear of birth and create fables to assuage their terror. She shares parables 
                to refute the fables.

              <p className="text-gray-300 mb-4">
                Lilith identifies &ldquo;The Great Fable: There is no end for we live forever,&rdquo; which creates a false hope for salvation. 
                She teaches, &ldquo;Life is not forever. It is a precious gift.&rdquo; She commands, &ldquo;Thou shalt not worship Satan,&rdquo; to Satan&apos;s 
                delight. She tells Emily and Julian that they are glorious.

              <p className="text-gray-300 mb-4">
                The group finishes its visit to the beach and Natalie says goodbye. Robert and Richard, Righteous envoys, arrive 
                to share the details of the celebration and inducement of Emily and Julian to be held the following day. The devils 
                mock the Righteous Plan. Lilith says, &ldquo;The Righteous swear Satan induces, when it is themselves.&rdquo; Satan rants a 
                drunken lamentation about his diminished role in the world and the miserable state of truth.

                After a farewell dinner, the group watches the sunset and Lilith weeps that Emily and Julian must be induced. She 
                elaborates the purpose of life in a simple round: &ldquo;Live well life well lived,&rdquo; with the best living being to fill 
                one&apos;s measure of creation.
